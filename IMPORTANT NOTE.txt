This project was created on the Jupyter notebook.
It’s generally a good idea to put the data in the same folder as your project, or in a subfolder, to make relative paths and loading the data easier.
So the data files needs to be present in the same path.
1. Please update the relative path of the csv datafiles in the python code to read these files correctly.
2. Also follow the folder structure of file if needed.
3. The folder New_eligible_states and Eligible_States contains the state wise data and they should be not renamed or if renamed please update the folder name/path 
in the ipynb file accordingly. These are in zip format , please unzip it for your usage.
